## Exercise 1 ##

# def has_a_lab?(string)
#   if string =~ /lab/
#     puts string
#   else
#     puts "Sorry, no lab here!"
#   end
# end

# has_a_lab?('laboratory')
# has_a_lab?('experiment')
# has_a_lab?("Pan's Labyrinth")
# has_a_lab?('elaborate')
# has_a_lab?('polar bear')

## Exercise 2 ##

# The program returns a proc because the block is never called. Nothing is 
# printed. 

## Exercise 3 ##

#  Exception handling is when there is some sort of error with the execution of 
#  the program.  If a programmer can anticipate what exceptions may arise, an 
#  exception statement can be added to the program, so that it doesn't completely
#  shut down the process. 

## Exercise 4 ##

# def execute(&block)
#   block.call
# end

# execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

## Exercise 5 ##

# The 'block' in line one is missing an ampersand that allows the program
# to recognize a block as an argument.
